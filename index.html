            <h1>SOCIAL STANDARDS & <br><span>ENCOURAGING OUR </span> <br>COMMUNITY</h1>
            <p class="par">Social services consists of facilities and services such as: public education,welfare, 
                infrastructure,mail, libraries, social work, food banks,universalhealth care, police, fire services, 
                public transportation and public housing.Social service is based on the ideal of brotherhood of man.
                 It is a natural impulse to help men in distress. It is a noble impulse. It cannot be rendered without an 
                 element of self-sacrifice. One has to spend time and energy for it. Nowadays man is concerned only about his 
                 own welfare. Obligations, noble thoughts, duties towards society have been pushed to the background as the 
                 centre-stage is occupied by a rat-race for materialistic trifles.</p>
